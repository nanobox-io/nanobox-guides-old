title: Installing & Updating Themes

WordPress themes provide a great way way to quickly and easily customize your WordPress install and make it unique to you and/or your company.

Installing and updating themes requires modifying the filesystem, which is why it's typically done through SFTP. However this poses a problem since the filesystem is read-only in production and sim apps on Nanobox. Luckily, Nanobox allows you to launch a local dev environment that gives you full write access to your filesystem where you can install and update themes.

## Run WordPress in Dev
If you walked through the [Setting Up WordPress on Nanobox](/wordpress/) guide, that you've already created a dev environment in your local Nanobox virtual machine (VM). If you don't have a dev environment setup, the instructions are outlined in the
[Run WordPress in Dev](/wordpress/#run-wordpress-in-dev) section of that guide.

### Start Your WordPress app in Dev
The quickest way to start your app in dev is to run:

```bash
$ nanobox dev run
```

This will start your dev environment if it's not running, then run the [start commands specified in your boxfile.yml](/wordpress/advanced/boxfile-explained/#start).

## Install & Update Themes Like You Would Normally
When using WordPress in dev, you can manage themes the same way you normally would. You can either manually download themes and include them in your `wp-content/themes` directory or you can install themes through your WordPress admin panel in your dev app. Theme files can be updated in your local filesystem and changes will be reflected in your running dev app.

## Build & Deploy into Sim & Production
Once themes are installed/updated in dev, you can generate a new build and deploy into `sim` for testing, then into production. The following guides walk through each:

[Deploy WordPress to Production](/wordpress/deploy-to-production)

### Active Themes in Each Environment
When you deploy a build to sim or production updated with a new theme, you'll need to go into your WP admin panel in each environment and activate the theme.

## Don't Store Themes in a Network Directory
Network directories are stored in your persistent network file-storage and are shared between all web nodes. It can be tempting to specify `wp-content/themes` or `wp-conent` as a `network_dirs` in your boxfile.yml, but this is a bad idea. Here's why:

### Slow Performance
Requests to network directories must traverse your app's network, adding latency to every request. While this latency is minimal, it can add up very quickly, especially since theme files are accessed on every page load.
